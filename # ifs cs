 Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that. Here are five sample C# `if` statements:

1. Basic `if` statement:
```csharp
int number = 10;
if (number > 5)
{
    Console.WriteLine("The number is greater than 5.");
}
```
Output:
```
The number is greater than 5.
```
2. `if...else` statement:
```csharp
int number = 5;
if (number > 5)
{
    Console.WriteLine("The number is greater than 5.");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("The number is less than or equal to 5.");
}
```
Output:
```
The number is less than or equal to 5.
```
3. Nested `if...else` statements:
```csharp
int num1 = 10, num2 = 20;
if (num1 > num2)
{
    if (num1 - num2 > 5)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Num1 is greater than Num2, and the difference between them is greater than 5.");
    }
    else
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Num1 is greater than Num2, but the difference between them is not greater than 5.");
    }
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("Num1 is not greater than Num2.");
}
```
Output:
```
Num1 is not greater than Num2.
```
4. Using conditional operators (`?:`) instead of traditional `if...else`:
```csharp
string result;
int score = 70;
result = (score >= 60) ? "Pass" : "Fail";
Console.WriteLine(result);
```
Output:
```
Pass
```
5. Chaining multiple conditions using logical operators (`&&`, `||`):
```csharp
int age = 25;
bool isMember = true;
decimal monthlySpending = 50m;

if (!isMember && (monthlySpending < 50 || age < 21))
{
    Console.WriteLine("User does not qualify for special discounts.");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("User qualifies for special discounts.");
}
```
Output:
```
User qualifies for special discounts.
```
