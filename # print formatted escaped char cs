The `@` symbol allows you to escape special characters or reserve words used in C# syntax without having to add additional backslashes (`\\`) beforehand. For instance, when printing a path containing directory separators like `\`, it would normally require escaping every occurrence with another backslash (`C:\\Users`). Using `@`, however, simplifies things greatly:

```csharp
string path = @"C:\Users\username\Documents";
Console.WriteLine(path);
```

The resultant output would then appear as expected:

```text
C:\Users\username\Documents
```

In your case, formatting text could involve utilizing interpolated strings, e.g.:

```csharp
string name = "Jane Smith";
int age = 25;
Console.WriteLine(@$"My name is {name} and my age is {age}.");
```

Output:

```text
My name is Jane Smith and my age is 25.
```

Note that the `$` sign enables interpolation while the `@` ensures no further processing occurs within the enclosed expression.
